# Library Management System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
A library management system is software designed to manage all the functions of a library. It helps librarians maintain the database of new books and books borrowed by members, along with their due dates. This system completely automates all library activities.

### 1.2 Scope
The system allows librarians to perform basic operations such as adding, updating, and deleting books, managing patron information, and tracking borrowing and returning activities.

### 1.3 Features
- **Book Management (Add, Update, Delete)**
- **Patron Management (Add, Update, Delete)**
- **Borrowing and Returning Books**
- **Display Available Books**
- **Fine Calculation**

## 2. MVC Architecture Overview

MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture is a design pattern widely used in software development, especially in building user interfaces. Here are the key features and advantages of using MVC architecture:

1. **Modularity and Separation of Concerns:**
   - **Feature:** MVC separates the application into three interconnected components (Model, View, Controller), each with a specific role.
   - **Advantage:** This separation allows for modular development, making it easier to manage, update, and extend different aspects of the application without affecting the others.

2. **Maintainability:**
   - **Feature:** Due to the clear separation of concerns, it's easier to maintain and update the codebase.
   - **Advantage:** Developers can make changes or add new features to one component without affecting the others, reducing the risk of introducing unintended side effects.

3. **Reusability:**
   - **Feature:** Components are designed to be reusable in different contexts.
   - **Advantage:** Developers can reuse models, views, and controllers in other parts of the application or even in different projects, promoting code efficiency.

4. **Scalability:**
   - **Feature:** MVC allows for the scalability of the application by independently scaling the components based on the specific needs of the system.
   - **Advantage:** This flexibility enables efficient resource utilization and better performance, especially in larger and more complex applications.

5. **Testability:**
   - **Feature:** Each component can be tested independently, making it easier to identify and fix issues.
   - **Advantage:** Unit testing and integration testing can be more effective, resulting in a more robust and reliable application.

6. **Adaptability to Change:**
   - **Feature:** MVC is adaptable to changes in requirements or technologies.
   - **Advantage:** When requirements change, developers can modify or add components without overhauling the entire system, making the application more adaptable to evolving needs.

7. **Enhanced Collaboration:**
   - **Feature:** Clear separation of responsibilities facilitates collaboration among developers, designers, and stakeholders.
   - **Advantage:** Teams can work more cohesively, with each team focusing on its specific area of expertise, leading to a more streamlined development process.

8. **Community Support and Standardization:**
   - **Feature:** MVC is a widely adopted design pattern with extensive community support.
   - **Advantage:** Developers can leverage established best practices, libraries, and frameworks that adhere to MVC principles, promoting consistency and standardization in application development.
